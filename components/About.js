                    Throughout my time with Bitwise, a nationwide tech company, I have harnessed my leadership capabilities in and outside the classroom by participating in their student lead study groups. I have contributed to the success of other students by excelling in the material presented. I also problem-solve any issues others may encounter while going through unfamiliar material and being clear and concise with my explanations to my peers.

                    What started my running journey was a book I read: "Canâ€™t Hurt Me" by David Goggins. I have now been running for a little over a year. I have run as little as half a mile 
                    and as much as a marathon this time. Running is not stale; each run has its personality, and how we navigate its characteristics is what makes us our own. I will continue
                    to run with the next goal of qualifying for the Boston Marathon in my upcoming LA marathon race, with Ultramarathons over the horizon.  <br/>
